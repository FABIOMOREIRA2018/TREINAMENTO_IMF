00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,010
Hello, everyone, the purpose of this session

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,380
is to introduce the main course assignment.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,330
As you can see, the course assignment is essentially

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,380
about the US household saving rate.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,290
And the basic question, actually, is whether the Great Recession

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,750
had a permanent effect on US household saving or a transitory effect.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,670
Now, this assignment is specifically designed

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,590
to test all the techniques and tools that you learned throughout the course.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,980


10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,910
Let me just walk you through the problem.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,150
Firstly, I'd just like to talk to you a little bit about what's

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,250
actually happened to US household saving from 1976 to 2014.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,850
And what you see in front of you is, in the red,

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,680
the actual household saving rate.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,710
And in the blue is a smooth representation of that line.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,450
We just smoothed out the short-run variations in the saving rate.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,450
Now, what's particularly evident in this graph

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,040
is the downward trend in the saving rate from about 1971

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,840
until 2007:4 that's occurred in the US.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,070
And what's particularly startling is that around the time of the Great

21
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,610
Financial Recession, which was actually around 2008,

22
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:34,080
first quarter, the saving rate jumped rather quickly and dramatically,

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,630
and continued to rise till about 2012.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,340
And then it seems to have actually fallen back on its downward path.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,860
So that's essentially the data that you'll be looking at.

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,970
And question is whether, in fact, the saving rate

27
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,942
will return to its pre-2008 level.

28
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,650
And obviously, that implies, essentially,

29
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,210
continuation of the downward path that we're starting to observe.

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,172
And it's, essentially, equivalent to asking

31
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:03,130
whether there's been a structural break in the consumption relationship

32
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,030
on or around 2008.

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,900
And so that's the assignment.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,750
So how do we go about doing it?

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,840
I mean, the first step is for you to develop an empirical model

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,420
for forecasting aggregate consumption rather than a saving rate

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:23,250
or emphasize aggregate consumption using data up until 2007Q4.

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,400
And then what you need to do is use the model

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,950
to forecast consumption and the saving rate during the 2008Q1 to 2014Q3

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,060
period, which represents the last data point

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,540
available in this particular dataset that I'll introduce later.

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,720
So we develop a model, estimate using data

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,051
that didn't include the Great Financial Recession,

44
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,300
and now, we're going to use it to forecast consumption

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,420
and saving rate during the period that was hit by the financial crisis.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,290
And once you've got the model, we're simply

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,420
going to formally assess whether the model can

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,000
predict actual consumption, and thus the saving rate, from 2008 onwards.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,180
So that's the basic problem.

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,390
Now, obviously, that's the basic problem.

51
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,600
Now, the dataset, it's available in module 1 online.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,500
And it can be found in this file called M1_Data.

53
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,650
And all the data that you'll be working with is in the page file, US_CY,

54
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,770
obviously representing consumption and income relationship.

55
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:36,440
It's quarterly data, and it spans 1947Q1 to 2014Q4.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,690
Some of the key variables that you'll find in that particular dataset,

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,340
and I'm hinting it's some of the variables you will be working with.

58
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,150
Firstly, it's obviously Real Consumption data; Real Disposable Income, rdy;

59
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,470
Real Net Worth, rny; the Unemployment Rate, unemp;

60
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,980
and also, Consumer Sentiment.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,160
So Real Consumption, Real Disposable Income, Real Net Worth.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,340
And you should think of these essential variables

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:15,750
as being essentially designed to predict the long-run path

64
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,450
of overall consumption.

65
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,650
The Unemployment Rate and the Consumer Sentiment variables, I mean,

66
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,470
we're providing them as a means of potentially explaining

67
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:35,330
short-run movements in rc.

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,240
In other words, actual consumption behavior.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,410
So they're the fundamental variables that you'll be working with.

70
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,450
Suggested approach.

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,550
Again, using data up to 2007Q4, develop an empirical model

72
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,930
for the long-run behavior in the household consumption.

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,888
And you might want to think in terms of the permanent income hypothesis

74
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:58,160
and explaining real consumption in terms of disposable income

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,970
and real net worth.

76
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,770
And in doing this, you want to be very careful to allow

77
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,340
for the fundamental properties of the data, and in particular,

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,820
whether the data are stationary or non-stationary.

79
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,080
And then using your preferred long-run model,

80
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,410
which you just estimated as a base, move on

81
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,270
to developing a model to predict the actual consumption behavior,

82
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,450
and that means allowing for variables that

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,950
deal with the short-run variation and actual consumption.

84
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,710
Now, obviously, movements in disposable income and real net worth

85
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,110
will also have implications in the short-run movements,

86
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,390
but they're more designed, potentially, to catch the long-run trends

87
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,420
in real consumption behavior.

88
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,220
Now, having done that and developed your short-run model,

89
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,340
you need to actually then connect your short-run model to the saving rate

90
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,250
by using the formula shown in front of you

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,820
to link aggregate real consumption or rc to the saving rate.

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,130
Now, notice here, the formula is well-known

93
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:04,550
and taken from the government NIPR accounts, table 2.1.

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,680
Notice that, basically, you have real consumption in there.

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,210
You have real disposable income.

96
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,020
That's what rdy is.

97
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,420
And you have income deflated to deflate normal payments to the household sector

98
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,040
from the government sector.

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,620
And that is the actual definition of the "saving rate."

100
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,110
To use that, add it to whatever you estimate.

101
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,170
You're then ready to both predict the level of real consumption

102
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,980
and the saving rate.

103
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,950
Now, once you're actually satisfied with your empirical model,

104
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,480
you then use it to assess its out-of-sample forecasting performance.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Now, that would probably require to use a simulator, the model simulator.

106
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,590
And the course will explain to you exactly how

107
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,440
you can do that using EViews.

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,970
Now, here's the bottom line.

109
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
If you can show that your final model can

110
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:59,910
predict the actual behavior of the saving rate during 2008Q1 to 2014Q3,

111
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,560
basically, that's very strong evidence that the financial crisis has not

112
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,930
changed saving behavior permanently.

113
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,510
So that's the bottom line is that you use the model that's

114
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,810
estimated with data prior to the financial crisis

115
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,730
and that can predict the behavior of the saving rate

116
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,071
after the financial crisis hit.

117
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,570
That's suggesting that there hasn't been a structural break.

118
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,080
Hints.

119
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,850
Some useful hints to help you specify your model.

120
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,230
I think it's worthwhile to start explaining

121
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,520
long-run movements in real consumption by using

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,300
real disposable income and real disposable net

123
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,554
worth as your exponential variables.

124
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,720
Now, you're free to experiment with other variables.

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,180
Indeed, there are many other variables in the dataset provided to you,

126
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,940
such as the mortgage rate, house prices.

127
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,240
Also, you will even have real government debt to deal with,

128
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,080
possibly the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis.

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,410
But it's up to you to essentially specify your long-run relationship.

130
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,410
I'm also suggesting the changes in the confidence level

131
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,330
and the unemployment rate tend to drive short-run movements in consumption,

132
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,060
and thus saving.

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,060
So you might want to think of those as exogenous

134
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,400
influences on consumption behavior.

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,860
Be sure to inspect before you regress, by which we mean,

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,490
essentially plot the data, have a sense of what's

137
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,310
actually happening in the data before you

138
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,280
think in terms of running a regression.

139
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,450
And I would strongly suggest that you look

140
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,630
at the problem in terms of the consumption-income ratio

141
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,280
against net-worth to income ratio, initially,

142
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,469
to get a sense of whether these two variables are moving,

143
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,470
how they're moving together over time.

144
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,730
Basically, it will reveal interesting features

145
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,520
between consumption and income.

146
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,260
And in particular, look out for changes in the relationship, especially

147
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,342
before 1976, and changes in the variability of underlying variables;

148
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,800
in other words, changes in the consumption and income ratio

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,290
and the real net-worth to income ratio.

150
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,610
And lastly, a detailed statement of the assignment

151
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,390
can be found in PDF file called M1_Assignment.

152
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,620
And that, basically, sets up the problem and describes in detail

153
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,140
the actual dataset that you'd be working with.

154
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,230
And also, it sets up a number of questions for you

155
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,200
to consider in preparing your solution.

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,692
And finally, we will be providing a suggested approach or a solution

157
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,650
at appropriate points in the course, by which I

158
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:42,290
mean that after you've done a module, say on testing the properties of time

159
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,360
series such as with the stationary and non-stationary,

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,550
we'll then apply these techniques to this particular dataset

161
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,389
and show you what the answers or what the outcome is of the various tests

162
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:56,430
that we're using and the implications that it has

163
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:05,090
for moving to the next stage of preparing a suggested solution.

164
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,880
So that's the assignment that you'll be working on throughout the course.

165
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,810
It's independent, by the way, of all the workshops and problem sets that you

166
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,970
are given at the end of every module.

167
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,930
It's voluntary, not to be graded, but it's specifically

168
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,460
designed to take you through from the very beginning

169
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,930
to the very end of producing an applied paper which

170
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,820
makes use of all the techniques that this course speaks

171
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:45,200
